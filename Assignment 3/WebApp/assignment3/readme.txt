FRWAW - Web Assignment 3 (siml).
Following is a small descriptions of the main features I have used and why.

The <canvas> Element:
Provides the PhotoBook, which is an interactive element that represents a physical book.
The canvas is used to transform the pages in the book to create a “flip” effect,
which allows the user to browse her collection one page at a time.

HTML5 Drag n Drop:
Allows the user to add photos to her collection by dragging images loaded from flickr onto the PhotoBook.
This allows for an intuitive user-experience since it mimics what an user would naturally do if creating a scrap-book.

HTML5 Local Storage:
Local storage allows the user to add a PhotoBook to her collection, making it possible for her to retrieve it again later.
Furthermore, she can delete previously created books.
This feature is used through the simple navigation menu that provides CRUD buttons and a dropdown for browsing the local storage.
